This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Introduction

The MEAN stack is a powerful set of technologies for building dynamic web applications. This project serves as a basic example of how to structure a full-stack app using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.

## Features

- CRUD operations with a MongoDB database.
- RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.
- Frontend built with Angular.
- Basic authentication (optional).
- Responsive UI with Angular material design.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building dynamic single-page applications.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend of the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, youâ€™ll need to have the following installed on your local machine:
